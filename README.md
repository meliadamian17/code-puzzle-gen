## Running The Repo
Under the assumption you have node and pnpm (dont use npm or yarn plz) installed, running the repo is simple:
1. Clone it 
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start the dev server


**Note**: This was done as a "take home" hiring task, not particularly "well engineered" or production ready code. Ended up being a really fun project.
